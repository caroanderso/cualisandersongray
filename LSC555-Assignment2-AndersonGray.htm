<a name="HeuristicEval"></a><h3>Heuristic evaluation of the system</h3>

<p><em>The Tower</em> 1922-2018 archive will be helpful to undergraduate professors hoping to incorporate original material into their teaching and learning exercises, but its organization and search functions can certainly be improved to better serve this purpose. </p>


<p><em>The Tower</em> archive passes some of the heuristic measures of evaluation, but fails at others. For example, the system can be slow to respond to searches, especially when it is searching individual issues, and there is not clear communication about how long it will take to return search results beyond the cues given by the browser. Within individual issues there are times when the user is greeted by a blank yellow screen while the system is loading the page of the PDF the user navigated to - the first time this happens the user might wonder if the system is broken, because there is no message about what is happening. When an individual issue is returning search results within it there *is* a pop-up that says what’s happening, but that step seems to happen relatively quickly, so the pop-up is only visible for a brief time and not as helpful as an explanation about a PDF page loading would be.</p>

<p><em>The Tower</em> has some features that work to match the system with how users approach it from the real world, but there is room for improvement. There is a helpful description of what the archive is, a disclaimer about what users might find there, and directions for how to find more recent issues on the home page. This helps orient the user, but it is also labeled as an “abstract” which is likely not how an average user would think of the explanation. On the same page there is also a note of the “Access condition” that reads “Copyright by the Tower Newspaper.” This is language that might make sense to some, but likely not to the vast majority of users, especially undergraduate students, if the professor wants to send them to the archive for research. This is an example of how the system could better explain what they mean by the information provided and why it’s there. </p>

<p>There is relatively good user control and freedom in most of the system. For example, if you click through on one of the sub-collections of the newspaper, presented in 20 year groups, there is breadcrumb navigation to help you get back to where you started. This does not extend, however, to searches you do of the whole collection. Once you have entered an initial search you are kicked to a results page that exists outside of the specific <em>Tower</em> archive, and it is not clear how to get back to the archive from there. There is no breadcrumb navigation. For example, if a student was assigned to find articles that explore the university’s position on co-ed housing, the student would be sent to a list of results that might be helpful, but if they weren’t, or if the student wanted to modify their search terms,  it’s not clear how they would get back to only searching <em>The Tower</em> 1922-2018 archive, rather than the entire special collection. If they click on an individual search result, however, they are back in the archive where the navigation is better.</p>

<p>I especially found navigating the individual issues easy to do - there were options for looking page by page, zooming in, and issue the system uses orange flags to help the user navigate to the part of the PDF that contains their search terms.</p> 

<p>The system overall does seem to generally follow standard conventions for archives - the search results are relatively easy to navigate as is browsing, and the system seems in line with other archives I have explored. I do think that using an archive might take some time for undergraduate students to get used to, but there wouldn’t be a terribly steep learning curve.</p>

<p>The system could do more on error prevention and helping users recover from errors. For example, when I executed a search that I didn’t mean to do, it was not clear to me how to redo the search within only <em>The Tower</em> archive, because of the problem mentioned above with kicking the user to a search interface that resets to searching the entire archive with no obvious way to get back. <a href="https://cuislandora.wrlc.org/content/documentation">There is basic documentation for the entire archive</a>, but it is not specifically helpful for navigating <em>The Tower</em> archive, and only explains the basics of search. It is also at the very bottom of the page, and simply labeled “documentation,” which is likely not a clear enough label for many users.<p> 

<p>The system does do a fairly good job - especially within the digital archive and individual issues - at making all of the navigation options visible for the user. For example, when a user is in the PDF of an individual issue there are options to view it by page by page, and once you are on an individual page, clear navigation on how to go to the next page, the next issue, see all pages, download the issue in various formats, and more. These are at the top of the PDF window, and relatively easy to navigate. They are especially useful in orientating the user about how to get to a different part of the archive.</p>

<p>I would note, however, that a professor might have to get a bit creative to incorporate a specific article into a lesson, because you have to download the issues page by page and there are not html versions of articles. You can, however, link to specific issues, so that might be an easy way to point students to a particular article.</p> 

<p>The design of the system has some room for improvement, but is generally well done. There is some clutter, especially on the home page of the <em>The Tower</em> 1922-2018 when the name of the newspaper is listed twice and there are unnecessary and confusing labels for the description of what the archive is and who holds the copyright, but the thumbnail images of different chunks of the archives are nice visual cues as to what comes next once you click (an archive), and the layout of the page where you can navigate to individual issues is quite minimal and straightforward. It’s not flashy at all, but quite navigable.</p>

<a name="SummarySystem"></a><h3>Summary of System</h3>

<p>The top two strengths of <em>The Tower</em> archive 1922-2018 are the display and navigability of individual issues, and the straightforward breadcrumbs inside the archive itself. The archive has done a good job of making PDFs of print materials navigable and easy to search. They have also made it easy to download the materials or share direct links to them so they can be saved and referenced later. (A caveat to this is that there is not a good way to share individual articles.) </p>

<p>In the image below you can see the orange flags that help the user navigate to the part of the newspaper where their search results can be found. I think this feature is especially useful because it helps replicate the experience of looking at a physical archive - you can see where in the issue the results are, how they are grouped, etc. </p>

<p>A bit higher up that same page you can see the helpful breadcrumbs that make it very clear where in the archive you are and how to get back to previous steps. </p>
<br>
<p><img src="https://github.com/caroanderso/cualisandersongray/blob/main/TheTower-Breadcrumbs.png?raw=true" alt="The Tower archive breadcrumbs" width="1000" height="250"></p>

<p>The biggest weakness of the system by far is that when entering a search of the entire collection (as opposed to within an individual issue), the search results list is displayed outside of the specific <em>Tower</em> archive. This is not an issue if the user then simply clicks on a search result, because then they are taken back into the archive with its breadcrumbs, easy navigation, etc., but if they want to modify their search they will likely inadvertently search the entire CUA archive, rather than the <em>The Tower</em> archive, and be lost. </p>
<br>
<p><img src="https://github.com/caroanderso/cualisandersongray/blob/main/TheTower-SearchResults.png?raw=true" alt="The Tower archive search results" width="1000" height="500"></p>
<p>The other major weakness of the system is also in the search results that are returned when you search the entire <em>Tower</em> collection. For example, as you can see in the search result above, there is the somewhat helpful “Title” of the issue that contains information relevant to the search, but the only other information it lists is the “Publisher” and “type,” both of which are the same for every piece of content in the <em>Tower</em> archive. The thumbnail is somewhat helpful in that it suggests what kind of content the user will find, but again if they are searching a newspaper archive this likely will not be a surprise. There is no listing of individual articles that contain information relevant to the search or any other information. Essentially this set-up requires two searches - first of the entire archive, and then another search within the individual issues. When you click on a result it does take you to the issue with the orange flags showing where in the individual issue your search term shows up, but no explanation of what they are - if you weren’t familiar with them you might not see them or know what they are and redo your search. Luckily, as discussed above, that search functions quite well within the individual issues. </p>

<p>Overall, <em>The Tower</em> 1922-2018 archive does a good job making a physical archive of historical materials accessible and navigable in a digital environment. It is not, however, as easy to navigate as some other information systems that give you more information about search results and avoid moving the user to different parts of the overarching information system without telling them. I do think that this system, especially with a few tweaks, would be useable for an undergraduate class - it might be a bit frustrating and require a learning curve at first, but ultimately it will be useful and might teach students a bit about archives and research techniques, and the challenges of digitizing historical materials. </p>
<a name="Comparison"></a><h2>Comparison of the Heuristic Evaluation of the System and Usability Test</h2>
<p>The most notable difference between my heuristic evaluation of the system and the usability test was that the user doing the test opted not to use the search function at all to complete his tasks. When asked why he didn’t, he said that it was because of the nature of the tasks - he thought it would be more expedient to use the chronological navigation to see how the newspaper had changed, and once he had gotten comfortable with browsing the archive that way he continued to do so for the second task. He also noted that the organization of the issues by year was easy to navigate, so that likely made it easier to browse that way as well. I also noticed that this organization was easy to navigate in my evaluation of the system. Because he avoided the search function the user also avoided the problems that I observed in my evaluation with the search results kicking the user to a different part of the archive. </p>


<p>The other major issue I noticed during the usability test was that the user was tripped up by a problem I also noted in my evaluation - that the PDFs loaded rather slowly, and when first using the system it seemed like something had broken or wasn’t there. A message from the system about what was happening and to wait likely would have helped ameliorate the problem. </p>

<p>Overall, the results of the usability test and my heuristic evaluation seem to be in line with each other. My top suggestion would be to add a message like “The PDF is loading; please wait” when individual issues are being pulled up.  I would also suggest reworking the system so the search results list is returned within the Tower archive environment rather than the broader archive. </p>
