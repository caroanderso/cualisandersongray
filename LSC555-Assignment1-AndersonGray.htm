Assessing the Arlington County Public Library Information System
</h1>
<p> LSC 555 Assignment #1 <br>

<h2>System introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> <p>The Arlington County Public Library was founded in 1936 when five independent libraries came together to form a county library system. Now it has seven branches, a central library, and a local history center, a tool lending location, and a makerspace called “The Shop.” The information system serves the entire library system that <a href="https://arlingtonlibrary.org/about-us" target="blank">serves over 1.5 million people a year</a>. The <a href="https://arlingtonlibrary.org/about-us-0" target="blank">“About us”</a> section of their website describes how they think about their information system: “In the always expanding digital realm, we provide people with powerful online resources. Online visitors can browse our collections, download eBooks, and view more than 100 digital tools.” The system includes a catalog for finding print and online materials. You can browse the catalog by searching, but there are also pages that provide recommendations, and a separate eCollection that connects users with databases and resources such as Kanopy and other online resources. </p></li>


<li><strong>Users:</strong> <p>This system serves the people of Arlington County Virginia. As noted above, they report serving over 1.5 million people a year. According to the Census, the population of Arlington is almost 250,000 people in 2024, so this means that they are either reaching populations beyond the geography area or counting people by visit. As a public library system their patrons come from all walks of life, from infants to senior citizens, though the population of Arlington has a large concentration of people between 25 and 35 years old.  According to the <a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/v/3/projects/documents/data-and-research/profile/profile_report_2024_final_4_3_24.pdf" target="blank">Arlington County Government snapshot</a> and the <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Arlington,_Arlington_County,_Virginia?g=060XX00US5101390072" target="blank">Census Bureau</a>, Arlington County is wealthy, with a median income in the 2020 census of $137,387, and highly educated, with 78% of the population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. 27% of the population works from home.  It is also a diverse population with people from over 150 countries. About 28% of people speak a language other than English at home. Given this, the system has to serve a wide population, but give special attention to younger adults with high educational attainment, as well as people who come from a diverse set of backgrounds. </p></li>


<li><strong>Content:</strong> <p>As noted above, the Arlington County Library provides a wide variety of materials in their information system. If we set aside program announcements and other information on hours and locations, etc. and focus on the <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/collection/" target="blank">“collection” section of their website</a>, we find a catalog of print and digital materials, as well as recommendations and instructions on how to download library apps, an “eCollection” section which helps the user navigate to databases organized by topic, such as “Book reviews,” “Language,” “Magazines and Newspapers,” “Streaming Video,’ and more. There is also a “more to borrow” section, which includes dolls, puzzles, tools, and even wireless hotspots. There is a “Research” section that connects the user with a librarian, includes a direct link to JSTOR, a link to a local history section, homework help, and more. </p>

<p>All of these resources are very robust. The resources listed above are searchable in the catalog, but also presented as separate resources on the web page, using the appropriate filters in the catalog to link to a display of the search results of what’s available. </p>

<p>The catalog seems to have over 300,000 books, eBooks, Audiobooks, and Movies available to search, not including the databases. A basic catalog record includes information on the author, what collections it’s part of, language, and what formats are available. The search results for <em>Jane Eyre</em> for example, show you what copies of the print book are available and where, as well as the audiobook on CD, the eAudiobook, the eBook, and the Kindle edition. It also includes a description of the resource, but only after the list of what formats are available. You can also filter the results by everything in the collection, what’s available now, and what’s available online. <em>Jane Eyre</em> did not include a publication date in its search returns, possibly because it’s in the public domain, but more recent books did show a publication year. </p>

<p>There is also a “browse” function that displays visuals of the resources available, and helping groupings such as “Popular” “NYT Bestsellers,” “New,” “New eCollection,” and more. When you click on the image it opens a pop-up with that item’s catalog record. From any catalog record you can add an item to a “list” that is created by the user and saved in the user’s account.</p>

<p>Another example of how robust the information system is the section dedicated to <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/collection/library-of-things/american-girl/" target="blank">American Girl dolls</a>, which you can check out of the library.  The section of the system for this includes a straightforward section on checking out the dolls, another section for checking out just their associated books, and another with materials created by the library that connects the historical periods of the dolls with what life in Arlington would be like.</p> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion of the System</h2>
<p>I am very impressed with the Arlington County Library’s information system. It is incredibly robust, and user-focused. There are multiple paths to find information, and it seems to anticipate the different ways its users are thinking about finding information. The resources are grouped in different ways, and there many different “recommendation” or “highlighted” resources to help people find a resource that might help them access what they are looking for. Notably, no chat feature. I didn’t miss it, but I wonder why they made that choice. </p>
<p>I also liked how the catalog uses written and visual cues to show what is available and what isn’t. As you can see in the image below, items that are checked out are in red, and items that are available are in green. I also like that you can preview electronic materials.</p>
<br>

<p>There are not many cons to this system, but if you are a very confident user who was looking for something specific you might not want to go through all the recommendations and featured resources and it’s a bit hard to get straight to a more advanced search of the catalog. On each and every page of the library’s website, however, there is a search bar that is integrated with the catalog, so I don’t think that would really be a problem. </p>
<p>This information system is also very focused on the collection - on the materials, be they physical or digital, written or object. It takes more clicks to get to the services that the library can connect people with, and even then it is focused on databases research resources, rather than connections to social services. I know that this is an important question facing libraries now - how much they should wade into the role of connecting their patrons with services - but it is notable how far the Arlington County Library information system leans away from doing that. I think they could make room in their information system to do just a bit more of that and possibly better serve the breadth of the population of the County. </p>
<p>One major improvement the system needs is a version in Spanish. While the catalog itself can be accessed in Spanish, the rest of the website cannot, including the explanatory text above the catalog and the book descriptions - even when it’s in Spanish-  and the navigation features.  As noted in the discussion of who this system is serving, <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/virginia/arlington" target="blank">about a quarter of Arlington’s population speak languages other than English, with over 12.69% speaking Spanish</a>. This is a sizeable enough portion of the population that the library should consider whether it can provide at least parts of its system completely in Spanish. While it’s admirable you can access the catalog itself in Spanish, it is less effective because the entire web page environment is not translated.</p>

<p>I would also  reassess whether to add a chat feature or some other way of asking a specific question online. There are small general and eCollection FAQs sections under the “Contact Us” link, but they are not extensive. </p>
<p>Overall, the Arlington County Public Library information system is robust, and seems to serve its users well. It seems pitched at the overwhelmingly highly educated and English-speaking residents of the county, I do wonder if more could be done to reach marginalized residents better - by having more of it translated and making that translation easier to find, and making it clearer what services the library can help connect its users to. I think the library should also consider how it can better incorporate connecting patrons with government, health, and other services into its information system, since that can be a powerful role the public library plays. </p>
